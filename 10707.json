Our tool provides the ability to analyze and study social media to understand how these spaces work, and how they can enable and prioritize trusted and safe content. This directly impacts the SDGs mentioned above in that our solution helps secure the information environment to build trust in experts and institutions, and promote healthier discourses for partnerships"
