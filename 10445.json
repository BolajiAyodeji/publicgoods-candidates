    "description": "Isidora can be used to generate crop and weather advisories that are location, crop and farmer specific. It uses a model for crop phenological development combined with historic and forecasted weather to alert farmers on important management actions to be taken at certain crop stages and for adverse weather conditions that may damage the crop at specific stages.\r\n",

This applies in particular for smallholder farmers which are often difficult to reach through (limited) agricultural extension services. The Isidora solution can be used to target individual farmers through mobile systems, providing them with advisories tailored to their specific crop, location and sowing data thereby promoting good agricultural practices. \r\n\r\nMoreover, as a result of climate change, weather tends to become more variable and adverse weather such as drought, flooding and extreme temperatures occur more frequent. The Isidora solution can integrate a weather forecast based on open weather data sources that can be used to alert farmers on such adverse conditions and take measures that can reduce their impact.\r\n\r\nThe Isidora solution was tested in the GeoBIS project in Bangladesh, it is being used in Myanmar as part of the Crop Insights Portal (https://www.impactterra.com/) and was used in Ethiopia for capacity building purposes."
