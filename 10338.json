Decidim provides transparency to each decision taken within a participatory process by making every vote, discussion, proposal and participation, open and published, so that a digital archive of the process remains for any needed audits. Decidim has also worked to implement traceability mechanisms against tampering which are reflected in Decidim's social contract: https://docs.decidim.org/en/develop/understand/social-contract#_transparency_traceability_and_integrity"

More information about our translation process here: https://docs.decidim.org/en/develop/contribute/translations.html\r\n- Governance: The software and the project Decidim is steered by its community. We do so in a democratic way by participating in a Decidim instance which help us make decisions. The instance is MetaDecidim and can be checked here: meta.decidim.org/ We also hold a list of principles which guide us into any decisions we take. These are here https://docs.decidim.org/en/develop/understand/social-contract you can understand more about our governance here https://meta.decidim.org/processes/Welcome\r\n- Testing: Every time a Pull request is opened",

We have guides for testers here https://docs.decidim.org/en/develop/develop/testing and you can check results of our tests  here: https://app.codecov.io/github/decidim/decidim\r\n- CI/CD: Decidim receives a lot of contributions.

Should an admin or user want to get in touch with another user, they would need to use the messaging feature. Any non-public fields, such as passwords and tokens are encrypted by default. In compliance with GDPR, Decidim offers a feature to download all your data and delete your account.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with our social contract, data integrity is very important to the legitimacy of participatory processes. Decidim is coded with a heavy reliance on action logging which ensure all changes done to participatory processes are traceable. For this we use the Papertrail library: https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail the application also operates all actions under a permission system. You can find more information here: https://docs.decidim.org/en/develop/develop/permissions.html\r\n\r\nExperimental features in democratic data integrity: In the case of Elections, we are working on a module that encrypts votes in every step of the way.
