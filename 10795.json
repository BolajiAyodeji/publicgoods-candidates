        "relevance": "SDG 16 - Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions: Open Terms Archive empowers citizens, civil society, regulators, and lawmakers to hold digital platforms accountable. This fosters:\r\n\u2022 democratic processes resilience by reinforcing protection against mis- and disinformation, as evidenced in the 2022 French elections: https://www.reset.tech/resources/memos-on-platforms-behaviour-during-the-2022-french-elections/\r\n\u2022 compliance with laws and regulations, as evidenced by the European Commission using Open Terms Archive to collect data for assessing the implementation of the platforms-to-businesses (\u201cP2B\u201d / 2019/1150) regulation\r\n\u2022 situational awareness for regulators, as evidenced by the usage of Open Terms Archive data by the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the French Department of Expertise in Digital Regulation.\r\n\r\nSDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals: Open Terms Archive actively seeks and facilitates collaborations with various stakeholders, including regulators, press and media, consumer protection associations\u2026 These partnerships aim at sharing all their capabilities to achieve a common goal: a more transparent, accountable, and just digital environment. For example:\r\n\u2022 The French Ministry for Foreign Affairs leveraging data collected by the German Universit\u00e4t Bremen.\r\n\u2022 The Swiss NGO HestiaLabs.ai collaborating with French consumer protection association UFC-QueChoisir following their common contributions to Open Terms Archive.\r\n\u2022 American NGO Reset.tech providing data to researchers around the world through Open Terms Archive: https://www.reset.tech/resources/memos-on-platforms-behaviour-during-the-2022-french-elections/\r\n\u2022 American members of Congress using joint achievements of the ToS;DR NGO and Open Terms Archive in Europe to support domestic legislation mandating more transparency in terms of use: https://trahan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2353\r\n\r\nSDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure: Open Terms Archive ensures accountability and transparency in digital infrastructure and digital service providers. While digital tools and digital infrastructure constitute an increasingly large part of development efforts, the terms offered by providers vary widely across jurisdictions. Open Terms Archive enables time-based as well as jurisdiction-based difference tracking, meaning it can show the difference between the terms offered by providers in varying countries. It also facilitates ensuring compliance by tracking changes following the enactment of legislation. For example, when the Malabo Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection will be ratified within the African Union, authorities and civil society will be able to check which private actors comply within the 30 days window that will be provided to them."
