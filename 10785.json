By supporting these impactful workers, we support progress toward the Good Health and Well-Being targets by extending access to basic public health and primary care in vulnerable communities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSDG8: Decent Work and Economic Growth: Many CHWs are unpaid and do not receive adequate support and training. Our advocacy training equips CHWs with the skills to push for inclusion in decision-making conversations to advocate for their rights."
