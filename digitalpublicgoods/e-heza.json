Preventing Errors:\n - \nE-Heza's decision logic model and all aspects of clinical care are governed by a clinical review process that includes physicians, healthcare workers, and digital health specialists. This work is reviewed by the E-Heza Executive committee. \n- Development work is open source and follows a peer review process in which all code is first reviewed by another developer before it is submitted to the QA process. \n- E-Heza adheres to best practices  privacy and data security standards to ensure the protection of private patient information. \n2. Learning from mistakes: \n- TIP Global Health's Model is based on gathering feedback and acting on it. There is a regular process of understanding challenges and potential errors which may cause harm. (https://tipglobalhealth.org/our-model/) \n- The feedback process is governed by the E-Heza Executive committee and overseen by the TIP Global Health Steering Committee. \n3. Promoting a culture of safety through safe practices and safe systems. \n - E-Heza’s training model is built to encourage co-design and encourages the foundational feedback mechanisms in order to understand both errors of omission and errors of commission."

Weekly audits are performed on the access logs, and the  logs are maintained for one year (and then archived through the prescribed backup retention plan). \n- E-Heza’s development operation prohibits the use of non-anonymized data in the development process. No developer may hold personal information on their local system to transfer any personal information from a non-production environment outside the course of the normal backup procedure. \n - E-Heza engages in third-party security audits in order to procure recommendations for further privacy and security procedures."
