      "Design With the User - User survey for the buyers as well as the sellers was done using google form and the responses were analysed to design UI/UX of the application. Survey questionnaire is put on Github (https://github.com/UNDPIndia/Aajeevika)",
      "Understand the Existing Ecosystem - Similar applications were analysed and based on the limitations of existing applications and needs of the end users, Aajeevika application was designed. Inputs were also taken from the Digital X (international experts in UNDP)",
      "Design for Scale - The database architecture is designed in such a way to accommodate scale.(more regions/states/countries, sectors, products, diverse users etc). The application is built to scale.",

Under this partnership UNDP is committed to  provide technical support in terms of advisory support, monitoring support , operations, maintenance etc. Government is ready to provide funding for further scale up of the application.",
      "Be Data Driven - Through this application the buyers could connect with SHG women/Cluster Level Federation (sellers) to make real time purchases. Further the application provides data insights on trend based on the feedback provided on the app for both buyers and sellers. Such analysis will be used to figure out the demand supply gaps and take necessary actions to optimize them in future. Field visits were done by UNDP team.",
      "Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation - Open APIs- The application is designed to provide  an open API  to extract the data  that can be used by any external  application/users. \n Open Data- The application is designed to support open data architecture enabling sharing data amongst a large collection of systems and query engines. The govt of Uttarakhand may or may  not be ready to share complete data set though. As of now, some part of data (govt schemes etc.) are open whereas as transaction on marketing platform is login based). \n Open Source -Open source softwares is being used.
