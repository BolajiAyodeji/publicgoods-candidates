Currently, Terrastories uses Mapbox GL JS for rendering a background map by default, but there is also the option to host your own tiles using the open-source map server TileServer-GL. It is on our roadmap to switch to MapLibre, the open-source fork of the Mapbox GL JS library prior to implementing a more restrictive license, once that project meets the sufficient conditions for map design and serving."
