It should be noted though that the master branch does include the Firebase SDK, which can easily be excluded for derivative work.\nThe project uses the Google Firebase SDK to collect non-PII information about the user as well as app events. Additionally, we have created specific Firebase events which are related to gameplay (whether someone completes a level, what their score was, etc.). The Firebase SDK can be excluded from being compiled into the app, in which case no data will be collected. All non-PII can be exported as non-proprietary JSON."
