For example ESRI ArcGIS online has been used in the implementation of the data hub component. Data Hub is dependent on ESRI ArcGIS. Major frontend components cannot be overhaul without re-writing the code base. Data displayed in the Data Hub is hosted and served from ESRI ArcGIS. As an alternative, the backend can be moved into local servers and serve with third party software such as GeoServer."

Data captured in the platform includes Open Data, Personal Data and Web Traffic Data.Open Data; is captured through the add resources and add data forms. Personal Data is mainly captured during stakeholder registration and contains PII; and - Web Traffic Data is captured anonymously through google analytics for purposes of monitoring the sites usage.During registration GPML Digital Platform users are required to create a profile including their name,email, affiliation, interests, expertise and geographical coverage. The stakeholder profile is only visible to registered users of the digital platform. Users have the option to decide whether their email should be displayed as part of their profile. The information will also be used in developing recommendation functionalities in the platform aimed at strengthening stakeholder engagement.Registered stakeholders can contribute knowledge to the digital platform by completing the add resource and add data forms to submit their resources and datasets. All the metadata submitted is openly accessible to all users of the digital platform. Submitted resources and datasets are attributed to relevant Stakeholder(s) that own the resources and is not a representation of UNEPâ€™s views, beliefs, or opinions. \nAdditional information on data captured and use is available in the terms of use/ privacy policy - https://digital.gpmarinelitter.org/privacy-policy-and-terms-of-use.pdf"

To achieve this, resources, data and stakeholders are validated before being made available on the platform. The purpose of the validation is to ensure that data and information submitted to the GPML Digital platform is complete, correct, accurate, comprehensive, usable and in line with UNEP's vision regarding plastic pollution and marine litter. The GPML Digital Platform Validation Process is a two-step process, beginning with an internal check by the GPML Team for content to be published and ending with an in-depth external check through the community of practices. User consultations on possible improvements to the process are underway. Additionally, security safeguards designed to protect Stakeholders data, such as HTTPS, have been implemented and systems are regularly monitored for possible vulnerabilities and attacks."
