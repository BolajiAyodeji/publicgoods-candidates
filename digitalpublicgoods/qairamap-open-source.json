Leaflet can be used as an open functional alternative to Google Maps."

These monitoring devices  (qHAWAX), are called 'Open Source' when it is decided to make the monitoring data known through an agreement with people or institutions that we work with. A qHAWAX device is a continuous air quality monitoring module developed by the qAIRa. They can monitor up to 5 polluting gases, including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). In addition, the qHAWAX monitors the amount of dust or particles (PM2.5, PM10) in the air and other variables such as pressure, temperature, relative humidity, UV radiation and noise. The sending of data from the qHAWAX is through a 2G/3G mobile cellular network. The main value of the qHAWAX module is to be able to show the INCA value (Air Quality Index, established by the Ministry of the Environment of Peru), which allows evaluating the level of air quality through 4 colors."
