Users can have also different levels of access across multiple projects, with system-wide SSO. We have automated email verification for all new users and all access permission requests are then manually reviewed and approved by project administrators; passwords are non reversibly encrypted and data collected by users is encrypted in transit using SSL certificates. Our central database is hosted on AWS and we have worked with AWS to improve security - we require MFA for all AWS users, we do not allow SSH access to the server (you have to use to use the AWS interface) and we do not use the root account. Finally, we also keep an auditable log of all API requests which allows us to forensically track any changes to data."
