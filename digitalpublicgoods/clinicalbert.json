As an example, the OMOP CDM team created a branch of the Common Data Model specifically for ClinicalBERT (https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/tree/payless_health - the branch is called Payless Health for the Foundation's payless.health search engine, which is powered by ClinicalBERT; the CDM team agreed to help revise the CDM according to how usage of ClinicalBERT evolves)."

Similarly, we have assessed such models for fairness using frameworks developed during the referenced postdoc (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05174). To be able to claim to use the ClinicalBERT standard in practice, a health system or hospital must conform to the API conformance tests such as these algorithmic fairness metrics."
