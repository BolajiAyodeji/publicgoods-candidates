No data is shared with third-parties without the express consent of the individual data subject.\r\n\r\nKiva Protocol stores identity data previously collected and stored by government identity agencies (e.g., civil registries, birth registries, voter registries, etc.). It also stores financial transaction data provided to individual data subjects by their financial service providers. Holding these data in Kiva Protocol\u2019s cloud-based digital wallet infrastructure typically provides higher levels of privacy and security than the on-prem or hybrid databases maintained by identity agencies in Kiva partner jurisdictions. Each data subject wallet is encrypted with its own key. A defense in depth approach is used throughout the architecture to ensure that no one failure can compromise the entire system. This includes, but is not limited to, a Web Application Firewall, separation of duties, regular dependency patching, and security monitoring. In addition, we run regular security audits to find and address vulnerabilities in our configuration, software and architecture. The last audit used ioActive."
