The solution is agnostic of geography and can be redeployed for any need of case management for the chronically ill who need to request assistance. The solution can be adapted with custom forms and the content on the public interface can be easily changed with no need for technical support. This type of digital solution is essential in the case of displaced populations as it allows them to request aid fast and easy for their medical needs and first responders can get a clear view of what availability exists to support them and provide them with. The platform is multilingual and allows for multiple interfaces for as many languages as needed with no need for extra development. A standard deployment in any emergency case would take under 24 hours. "
