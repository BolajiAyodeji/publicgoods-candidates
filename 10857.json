New versions are built and deployed automatically.\r\nContinuous Deployment - New builds are deployed frequently and automatically to production once tests pass to accelerate delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchitecture:\r\nLoose Coupling - Components are logically separated to allow flexible scaling and improvement. Event-driven architecture decouples backend services.\r\nREST APIs - Backend services expose REST APIs for structured communication as per industry standards.\r\nClient-Server - Distinct client-server separation of concerns improves efficiency and scalability.\r\nHorizontal Scaling - Stateless application design and use of Kubernetes allows easy horizontal scaling.\r\nCloud Native - Following cloud computing best practices around high availability",
