            "evidenceText": "Accessibility is hard for many reasons. While current tooling provides mechanisms for detecting most accessibility violations, there remains a certain amount of disconnect between the developer and the problems they are causing. Most of these errors are things we can’t see, things that won’t affect us, and things without a perfect, exact fix.  tota11y aims to solve these problems by providing a fun, interactive way to see accessibility issues. Not only should the web be fully accessible to all, but developers should feel empowered to fix and prevent accessibility violations from happening in the first place.",

In many cases, developers must have some prior accessibility knowledge in order to make sense of the results.  Instead, tota11y aims to reduce this barrier of entry by helping visualize accessibility violations (and successes), while educating on best practices.",
