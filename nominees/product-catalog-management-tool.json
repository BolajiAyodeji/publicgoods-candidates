  "description": "The Product Catalog Management Tool aims to connect product catalogs in order to show a clear journey from manufacturer to patient. It establishes master data that includes GS1 identifiers, global categories, and mappings to local identifiers. This enables end-to-end visibility, allows shipments to flow between systems, and helps supply chains perform.",

      "evidenceText": "PCMT is aimed at improving product catalog data governance, so that public health systems are more efficient and serve their people better with available supply. \nTarget’s 3.7 and 3.8 are focuses of PCMT.  Both of these targets require more efficient health supply chains, and that’s a primary goal of PCMT.   In particular PCMT aims to achieve this by increasing the connectivity between health domains (e.g. clinical coding) and supply chain operations by allowing local product catalog contexts to be mapped to adjacent (e.g. public and private care and supply chains) and global (e.g. manufacturing, suppliers, shipping) contexts.  In our experience this work of mapping product catalog codings between contexts happens already, however the typical tools are spreadsheets and disconnected databases (e.g. regulatory or supplier).  PCMT aims to supplement the use of these disconnected datasets and associated people, and bring their workflow into a common tool and community of practice, where those stakeholders follow a workflow of data curation that fits changing health requirements (e.g. new diseases and their medicines) supply characteristics (availability, regulatory approval, lead times, cost). \nAs evidence for the application of to both of these targets, PCMT is already in use as a backing technology to curate datasets for family planning, essential medicines, vaccines and other medical product catalogs, both in local and global operations teams.",
