Reveal combines a web-based tool that facilitates detailed planning by field managers, and a mobile tool that guides front-line health workers through highly interactive, self-navigating digital maps down to the household level. Reveal has been developed alongside country governments and implementing partners across ~10 countries to support public health interventions such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria, mass drug administration (MDA) for neglected tropical diseases, and routine childhood vaccination campaigns for vaccine-preventable diseases."
