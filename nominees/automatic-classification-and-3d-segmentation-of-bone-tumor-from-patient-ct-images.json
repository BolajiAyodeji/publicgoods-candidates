  "description": "Aim of this project is to use Artificial intelligence, specifically, deep learning methods to automate 3d bone tumor detection, segmentation, 3d reconstruction and classification of pelvic bone tumour types by applying deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks on volume datasets of variety pelvic bone tumours types in nifty (.nii) format and apply convolutional networks UNET (in segmentation) and DenseNet (in classification) to extract the prediction training Model. All that done using python language and predefined image processing , convolution and image-to-numerical arrays-transforms libraries, Pytorch and MONAI  (Medical Open Network for AI )",
