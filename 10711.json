        "relevance": "Mapping global agricultural lands, and related land conversion, directly supports work to increase food security. The \"Sentinel-2 10m Land Cover Time Series of the World from 2017-2022\" layer displays a global annual map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 9 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of each year. It includes classifications for crops and flooded vegetation.\r\n \r\nMapped urban areas and trends in urban development can be seen on the LULC map. At 10m scale we can also identify large green spaces in urban areas and agricultural peripheries.\r\n \r\nLand cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions).  The LULC map, in combination with climate and carbon models, helps users identify important areas for natural carbon.\r\n \r\nThe LULC map is directly tied to how we live on land and can map land cover conversion over time."
