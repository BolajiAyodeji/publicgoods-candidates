        "relevance": "SDG3: The Orthanc ecosystem supports individuals, health professionals, institutions, and governments in managing their medical images. Orthanc can notably be used as an efficient PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) for emerging economies. It is also widely used to exchange medical images between remote sites for continuity of care. Finally, thanks to its support of teleradiology, Orthanc provides an effective way to ask for remote expertise in areas with sparse medical expertise.\r\n\r\nSDG4: The mission of the Orthanc project is to share technological knowledge about medical imaging (in particular, about the worldwide DICOM standard), as well as about algorithms for the analysis of medical images (which includes deep learning). Faculties of medicine, schools of nursing, and schools of engineering can use the versatility of the Orthanc ecosystem to teach medical imaging.\r\n\r\nSDG9: Thanks to its focus on DICOM interoperability, Orthanc is used by many companies around the world as a vendor-neutral gateway between hospitals and industrial products. Orthanc can also be used by researchers and software engineers to turn their own computers as a mini-PACS that emulates a full hospital PACS environment, which facilitates development and fosters innovation. Infrastructures to exchange medical images between hospitals, radiology centers, schools, companies, and research centers can be deployed using Orthanc, including in cross-border contexts."
